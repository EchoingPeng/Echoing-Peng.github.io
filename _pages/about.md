<p>Hi, I am Guanru Peng, or you can just call me Frank.</p>

<p>I am a MSIS student of School of Information and Library Science, UNC-CH, and will graduate in Dec, 2019. Before starting my Master degree, I had some experience with text mining and computational linguistics.</p>

<p>I am interested in NLP and information retrieval area, but I spent last two years on some famous front-end programming techniques, and in the last period of my master degree, I will focus myself on Web development. Yes I still love NLP, but research requires much higher mathematical skills than my current level. </p>

<p>Since my graduate date is approaching, I'm thinking about having a full-time SDE in Raleigh, Durham or Chapel Hill. Please you have any empty role related to front-end development, please send me an e-mail!</p>

<p>Thank you for reading!</p>
