All right this is my first blog on my github page. Jekyll actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be and made my 
life much easier. There is still a lot of work to do, like adding more styles to page, writing more blogs, and getting my CV 
formated and post on the page. 

I also need to add a few lines of introductions...
