Got the page beautified after playing around with Jekyll a little bit. The previous version is just too simple and crude. I thought Jekyll is a pretty straightforward site generator, but still ran into some trouble when I try to add a gem-based Jekyll theme and got Ruby env set up. Jekyll theme is not able to provide everything I need in the exact way I want. But the workload of building everything from scratch is just overwhelming. Well, it looks like that the page is finally acceptable, for now. 

I also need to upload some new posts about data structures and algorithms.
